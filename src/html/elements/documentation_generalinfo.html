            <p>Soc-core is a Sass framework providing styling for base elements of Soc style, an in-house developed front end
                framework in order to maintain a similar look and feel for all kinds of administrative websites. Soc-core
                is built on top of the official Bootstrap Sass port, this allows for all known Bootstrap components and style
                elements to be used as well. Some of these might have been overridden by the Soc-core style but efforts were
                made to keep this limited as much as possible. For more information visit the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com"
                    alt="bootstrap">bootstrap</a> website.</p>
            <p>This website is developed to provide examples and documentation of the various components. To use a component
                you can either look at the source and alter the code to fit your needs, or run the emmet snippet provided
                below the component in a well if your IDE provides support for <a href="https://emmet.io/" target="blank">emmet</a>.
                When developing in Visual Studio Code emmet is provided out of the box and can be used by pressing Tab after
                the emmet snippet. Of course when using the examples don't forget to include the required css and js files.</p>
