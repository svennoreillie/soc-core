            <p>Soc-core is a Sass framework providing styling for base elements of Soc style, an in-house developed front end
                framework in order to maintain a similar look and feel for all kinds of administrative websites.</p>
            <p>This website is developed to provide examples and documentation of the various components. To use a component
                you can either look at the source and alter the code to fit your needs, or run the emmet snippet provided
                below the component in a well if your IDE provides support for emmet. When developing in Visual Studio Code
                emmet is provided out of the box and can be used by pressing Tab after the emmet snippet. Of course when
                using the examples don't forget to include the required css and js files.</p>
