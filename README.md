# soc-core

v0.1.0

## Description
This is a sass framework providing styling for base elements of Soc style. 

Soc is an in-house developed front end framework in order to maintain a similar look and feel for all kinds of administrative websites.


## Setup
### Installing prerequisites
* Download and install [git](http://nodejs.org/download/) for your OS 
* Donwload [nodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/) for your OS and install. Check by running 'node -v' in a terminal window.

* Because npm is more frequently updated than node, update it by running 'npm install npm@latest -g'

### Quick Look
When all prerequisites are met, having a look at the style is possible using only 3 commands.

* Open up a terminal at a desired empty folder, make sure you have sufficient administrator rights. 
* Run 'git clone https://github.com/svennoreillie/soc-core.git'

### Extending the project
Make sure you have all the prerequisites as mentioned above.

Soc-core is created using Visual Studio Code and it is recommended you use this IDE when contributing to the project. When this project is opened in Code, press Ctrl+Shift+B to run the default build task, the project is configured to install all npm packages, pack the project using webpack, starting a dev server and opening the default browser to the created website.

When Visual Studio code is not an option install npm packages manually and run 'npm start' in a terminal window at the root of the project.
After this you can navigate to 'http://localhost:8080' (or a different port if the default one wasn't available) to view the example website. 

The project is setup to be a live session, meaning changes made in code will automatically trigger a refresh in the browser.
